Great book by Tim Berners-Lee on the making of the WWW [Weaving the Web](https://www.amazon.com/Weaving-Web-Original-Ultimate-Destiny/dp/006251587X/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=006251587X&pd_rd_r=4QY2XBMKK8Z8F32XTHFC&pd_rd_w=JiTJY&pd_rd_wg=DownU&psc=1&refRID=4QY2XBMKK8Z8F32XTHFC)

1991 - 1995 saw rapid expansion of the HTML specification, and the first commerical web browser was released in December 1994, Nescape Navigator 1.0.  

__HTTP 1.0__ was formalized in 1996
* Biggest change was response object was not limited to hypertext.  
* Saw the Accept: */* header standardized.
* Introduced _POST_

__HTTP 1.1__ was formalized from 1996 - 1999.  
* Formalized _OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT_
* We've been going strong with 1.1 for many years!
